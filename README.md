# Diabetes Prediction Web Application
This project is a machine learning-driven web application aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters provided by the user. The application leverages Logistic Regression for prediction, providing an easy-to-use interface through Flask. This tool is designed to help individuals assess their diabetes risk quickly and intuitively by entering specific health metrics, with predictions grounded in statistical analysis and machine learning.

# Project Workflow
## Data Cleaning: 
The dataset undergoes a rigorous cleaning process to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Key insights are extracted from the data through visualization and statistical summaries, uncovering trends and correlations in factors related to diabetes risk.

## Feature Engineering:
Relevant features are selected and engineered to optimize model performance and improve prediction accuracy.

## Model Selection & Training:
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the cleaned and processed dataset, providing reliable diabetes risk predictions based on user inputs.
## Web Application Development:
A Flask-based web application was developed to offer users a simple, interactive interface for inputting health metrics and receiving immediate diabetes predictions.
